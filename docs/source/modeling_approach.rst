To achieve the project's objectives, we will follow a systematic approach that involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and employing appropriate modeling techniques. The key steps of our modeling approach are outlined below:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning all of the datasets to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
   - Integrating the various datasets, including Opportunity Data, and Product Data.
   - Transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conducting an in-depth EDA to gain insights into the distribution of consumer geographies, opportunity stages, and their relationships.
   - Visualizing trends in consumption market, product segment, and risk status to identify patterns and correlations.

3. Transaction Analysis:
   - Analyzing the time taken between stage transitions for different geographies.
   - Evaluating the proportion of won lines across product categories to identify emerging themes and potential growth areas.

4. Sales Drivers Identification:
   - Conducting correlation analysis between opportunity data, and product data to identify latency trends.
   - Utilizing feature importances from models to identify the key drivers of product sales.

5. Reporting and Visualization:
   - Presenting the findings via reports using clear and concise visualizations, charts, and graphs.
   - Documenting the modeling process and outcomes for better reproducibility and future reference.

By following this approach, we aim to provide Manufacturer A with actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to enhance their market position and drive business growth.
